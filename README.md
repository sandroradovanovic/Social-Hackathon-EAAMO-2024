## Overview

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women; in Mexico, it contributes to 30% of malignant neoplasia in women, and the incidence rate was 40.5/100,000 inhabitants in 2020. Data from the Population-based Cancer Registry in Merida (PBCR)-Merida reported an age-adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer of 49.3/100000 in 2022 (Leal Y, 2020).   Studies have estimated that established risk factors for breast cancer could explain up to 70% of postmenopausal breast cancer cases in the US non-Hispanic White population. However, only approximately one-third of cases could be prevented by modifying lifestyle factors such as weight, menopausal hormone therapy, alcohol use, and physical activity (Ou JY, 2020).  

In Mexico, a health equity study in Mexican women with breast cancer reported a significant relationship between education level and socioeconomic status and breast cancer prognosis (Sollozo-Dupont I,2023.   For example, environmental exposure is caused by the widespread and varied exposure to carcinogens and endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment. Among the risk factors described for BC, an attempt has been made to integrate genetic susceptibility and modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Lifestyle changes and the built environment have had an impact on BC risk factors such as excess body weight, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, delay of childbearing, fewer childbirths, and excluding lactating. However, these factors do not fully explain the increase in BC cases, let alone the continued increase in the disease. Among women who develop BC, not all have a family history, suggesting the role of environmental chemical exposures in the development of the disease. 

Emerging evidence indicates that toxic chemicals in the air may be associated with BC risk; air pollution has been classified as a carcinogen in humans by the IARC (IARC, 2013). There are two physiological mechanisms to explain the link between air pollution and BC development: a) Genetic mutations and air pollution may directly cause genetic mutations, as they are carcinogenic risks. PM 2.5, PM 10the environment can penetrate deep into the lung and get into the bloodstream, where they are absorbed into the breast and other tissues. Breast cancer can take a long time to develop; more recent exposures may not be the most relevant.

Moreover, studies that only look at exposure to environmental hazards later in life may not account for effects from earlier exposures. There is evidence that air pollutants can change the architecture of the breast (Niehoff NM,2020) by increasing breast density. Air pollutants may affect breast cancer incidence by increasing breast density, female hormones affect breast density, and some air pollutants exhibit endocrine-disrupting properties(Kotaque R, 2023). Data from experimental studies suggest that heavy metals possess both xenoestrogen properties, or EDCs (endocrine disrupting chemicals) that disrupt the natural hormonal balance and carcinogenic properties, offering a potential hypothesis for association with levels of lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium in air pollution suggest an increased likelihood of developing BC in women exposed to these chemicals’ hazards through air or water. 

In recent years, a better understanding of heavy metals and endocrine disruptions, even at low concentrations. For example, the metallic components of air pollution exposure can last for half-lives and accumulate in breast tissue. There is a clear need to understand better how these risk factors could have an impact on breast cancer mortality, particularly in high-risk populations and low-income communities, who are disproportionately exposed to hazards and chemicals in the environment, have more social disadvantages reducing their healthcare access, and are typically underrepresented in research studies. Novel approaches are required to develop evidence-based public health decisions between environmental exposures, social risk, healthcare access, and breast cancer mortality surveillance.
